# Neonatal Brain Atlas Construction: A Review & Resource List

> Official repository for the review paper: **"Neonatal Brain MRI Atlas: current and future"**

## 📂 Resource Navigation
We have organized the resources into four categories corresponding to the evolutionary stages discussed in the paper:

### [1. Static & Iterative Templates](01_Static_and_Iterative)
> Covers the foundational phase from single-subject rigid templates to unbiased groupwise registration using tools like **ANTs (SyN)**.
> * **Keywords:** *Linear Registration, Groupwise Averaging, Sharpening.*

### [2. Spatiotemporal (4D) Atlases](02_Spatiotemporal)
> Focuses on continuous time-aware modeling to resolve temporal inconsistencies ("jumps") in brain development.
> * **Keywords:** *Kernel Regression, 4D Modeling, Longitudinal Trajectories.*

### [3. Probabilistic & Multimodal Atlases](03_Probabilistic_and_Multimodal)
> Includes methods that model anatomical variability (GMM) and integrate complementary modalities (DTI/fMRI).
> * **Keywords:** *Tissue Probability Maps, Multi-shell Diffusion, dHCP.*

### [4. Deep Learning-Based Templates](04_Deep_Learning)
> The frontier of atlas construction, featuring generative models and implicit neural representations.
> * **Keywords:** *VoxelMorph, Atlas-GAN, CINEMA*
